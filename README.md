                                               Less carbon, more carGoo 


                                                 

carGoo is a project created to counter the high amount of carbon dioxide created by cargo companies through large distribution networks.

##  How does carGoo works?

A web server that provides free charging for electrical cars by encouraging individuals to carry cargo on the route they will go. High amount of carbon dioxide created by cargo companies through large distribution networks.

Another problem is that the cargo companies send the cargo delivered to them to the next day in order to fill their trucks. These reduce brand satisfaction by delaying customers' arrival of their cargo. Such problems cause loss of customers and profits.

We are a dynamic team that comes together with the motto of sustainability and innovation. And now, in the light of these goals, we are a web application that reduces the workload and costs of our partner cargo company while providing free electric charge to our drivers in exchange for carrying cargo on the route we have optimized.

Currently, at least 4 different vehicles are used in a cargo process. In return, we aim to encourage environmentally friendly electric vehicle transportation. We include electric vehicle owners as drivers in our system with the opportunities we offer.
